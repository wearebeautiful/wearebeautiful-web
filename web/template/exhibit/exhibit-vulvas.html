   This vulva model of a mother who has given vaginal birth shows an interesting body history event left over
   from the birth of the child. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episiotomy">episiotomy</a> is a medical
   procedure to make an incision on the lower portion of the vagina in order to increase the size of the birth canal
   so that the baby can be born without causing uncontrolled tearing in the vaginal walls.

   You can see this scar near the bottom center of this model, running in a diagonal line towards the right.
<p>
<p>
   This vulva is also interesting in that neither the labia majora nor the labia minora are very pronounced.

   This vulva model on the other hand has very pronounced labia minora. The contrast betwen this vulva model
   and the previous model shows how wide the range in labia minora can be.

   The fingers you can see in this model show off a <em>retracted</em> model, where the female was using
   her fingers to retract her labia in order to provide a better view of her clitoris.
</p>
<p>
   Even with these models we need to be careful -- we cannot use models that show rings or other identiying
   marks, which could be used to identify the model.

   This transgender person has a vulva with a clitoris that shows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoromegaly">
   clitoromegaly</a>, which has been caused by hormone treatments. 
</p>
<p>
   This model is also an example of an <em>arranged vulva</em> where the labia minora has been arranged
   to be symmetric in order to clearly show the elongated clitoris.
</p>
<p>
   We encourage you to take a closer look at this vulva to see how the clitoris looks compared to the 
   other vulva models in this exhibit.

   Here we have our first compound model that is comprised of two separate scans. You can clearly see how 
   the skin is smooth on the left side, but has goose bumps on the right side. This is because the female
   in this model was not aroused during the left scan, but aroused during the right scan.
</p>
<p>
   These scans can be very difficult to create, since it is challenging for us to ensure that the model
   is positioned in exactly the same way in both scans. While this model wasn't perfect, we can see
   how the labia minora moved up slightly and if we rotate the model to look at the center line
   from the edge, we can see how the vulva has become more full with arousal.
