      <p class="team-name">Anonymous Helpers</p>
      <p class="team-title">System Administration, UX Consulting</p>
      <p class="team-desc">
        We had a number of other people help us with this project. In particular a friend of the project
        spent a lot of time advising us on how to setup our hosting infrastructure for
        optimium efficiency and stability. Another friend advised us how to create the proper 
        User Experience for our site, ensuring that the site is useful, easy to understand and working 
        as one would expect a modern web site to work. 
      </p>
      <p class="team-desc">
        However, due to the sensitive nature of this site, these helpers would prefer to remain
        anonymous. Thank you very much anonymous helpers, we couldn't have done it without you!
      </p>

      <h2>Advisors</h2>
      <p>
         While we were creating this project we needed to learn quite a few things
         about the nuances of human sexuality. We also needed advisors to review
         our work to ensure that our work was accurate, inclusive and sensitive.
         Our board of advisors have given many hours of their own time to help
         the creation of this project. Thank you to all of you!

         As a journalist specializing in sex education, Shauna has seen all too often what can 
         happen when people don’t receive adequate sex education. She hopes that We Are Beautiful

         how beautiful they truly are.

         Ms J is a healthcare provider in emergency care. She spent many years involved in sexual health 
         promotion and education as well as working as a birthing consultant. Since her early days, the human
