        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">GitHub Respositories</h4>

        <p>
           On our <a href="https://github.com/wearebeautiful/">GitHub page</a> you can see all of the respositories
           that make up the We Are Beautiful project:
        </p>

        <ul>
           <li>
             <a href="https://github.com/wearebeautiful/wearebeautiful-web">wearebeautiful-web</a>: All of the 
             code and scripts needed to run this website.
           </li>
           <li>
             <a href="https://github.com/wearebeautiful/wearebeautiful-surfaces">wearebeautiful-surfaces</a>:
             All of the surfaces, solids and public metadata which are the sources for the models on our site.
             This repository should be considered the master archive of our models and surfaces.
           </li>
           <li>
             <a href="https://github.com/wearebeautiful/wearebeautiful-models">wearebeautiful-models</a>:
             All of the processed surfaces, solids and public metadata ready for display and download
             on our website. All of the models in this repository have been derived from the
             <em>wearebeautiful-surfaces</em> archive. This repository should be considered a convenience repository
             and if anyone would like to fix or improve any of our surfaces or solids, it should not be done
             in this respository -- use the 
             <a href="https://github.com/wearebeautiful/wearebeautiful-surfaces">wearebeautiful-surfaces</a>
             instead.
           </li>
           <li>
             <a href="https://github.com/wearebeautiful/wearebeautiful-tools">wearebeautiful-tools</a>: The tools
             required to turn surfaces into solids, scale and clean up solids, add model codes, create
             the master database and other tools that support creating the data for this site.
           </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Many of our models contain minor errors in their surfaces. While we've worked hard to reduce these 
          errors, some still remain and we can't really spend the time to fix absolutely every last problem.
          (Release early, release often, right?) We're certain that all of the models are printable and viewable,
          which is our primary concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you feel like helping us remove the errors from our models, we'd love to received pull requests to our 
          <a href="https://github.com/wearebeautiful/wearebeautiful-surfaces">wearebeautiful-surfaces</a> respository.
