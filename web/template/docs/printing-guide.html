        <h2>Our models and surfaces</h2>

        <p>
          From this web-site you may download and utilize these three resources:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> 
                   <b>solids</b>:
                   These solid files are in the STL file format, a common format used to distribute 3D files that are
                   intended to be printed on your own 3D filament or SLA printer. Often these files require no
                   more work than to print any other STL file you might download and print. Each solid file contains the solid
                   itself, marked with the URL of this site as a <a href="{{ url_for('docs.model_codes') }}">model code</a> that 
                   clearly identifies the human model. Our goal is to make every 3D printed model easy to look up, so that anyone 
                   wishing to find out more about a model can use the code on the physical model to find the information about 
                   the human model here on our site.

                   <b>surfaces</b>: 
                   Surface files are also in the STL file format, but are not printable. These files are provided for
                   people to use in any way they see fit. You can import these files into 3D modeling software with the goal
                   of creating a new model/surface. What you end up doing with these files, is entirely up to you! We encourage
                   creators who use one of our surfaces to still include the <a href="/docs/model-codes">model code</a> so that users may 
                   still look up the information about the model on our site.
                </p>
                <p>
                   If you create something fun with one of our surfaces, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and share a 
                   picture or STL files with us!

                   <b>screenshots</b>: 
                   Each of our 3D models has a screenshot image that we use to display previews on our site. These images are
                   useful for sharing links and communicating about this project online.

        <h2>How to print our models</h2>
  
        <p>
           We work hard to create models that are ready for printing. However, the process is still a bit of an artistic 
           undertaking and prone to massive amounts of errors at every step. A lot of our solid files are not perfect,
           but they are good enough. If you feel that the errors that remain in our files are unacceptable, we'd love to 
           receive improved models from our users. You can find our <a href="https://github.com/wearebeautiful/wearebeautiful-models">
           model repository at GitHub</a> and if you have an improved solid/surface, please open a pull request there.
        </p>

        <p>
           Printing our models should be pretty straightforward -- the solid files are ready to print. The units of the solid
           files are in millimeters (mm) and we work hard to ensure that the scale of the models is correct. If you print one of
           our solids at 100% (e.g. without scaling it before printing) it should print life-size just like the original human
           model. We recommend using non-transparent filament to print models that are intended for educational purposes --
           transparent filament makes it harder to see details on a print.
        </p>

        <p>
           Most of our models should be ready to import into your favorite slicing/printing software. Some may need rotations 
           and quite a few will likely need to be scaled down, unless you have a very large printer. When printing breast 
           models you may want to consider standing the model up (as they are shown on our site) in order to avoid unsightly 
           countour lines. Some experimentation might be needed to get a clean print, but overall it should not be very hard.
        </p>

        <h4>Tips for specific models</h4>

        <ul>
           <li>
             <b>Penis models:</b> These often times print better if the models are oriented so that the tip of the penis points up.
           </li>
           <li>
             <b>Body models:</b> Lower body, upper body and full body scans often print best with the model code down.
           </li>
           <li>
             <b>Breast models:</b> Breast models can print well in their orientation as downloaded, but sometimes contour lines
                can be visible if the layer height is not fine enough. Standing the model up, as the person would stand normally, 
                can give better results.
           </li>
           <li>
             <b>Vulva models:</b> These are the easiest to print, simply print them in the same orientation as downloaded.
             However, the standing models (with an S in the second letter of the <a href="{{ url_for('docs.model_codes') }}">model 
             code</a>, such as VSNN) will need a rotation to print correctly.
           </li>
        </ul>
