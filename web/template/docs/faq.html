        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Why did you create this site?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We were saddened by the state of materials that are available for sexual education and we are appalled
          at how difficult it is in some countries to get good information about human bodies and about sex. Entirely
          too many taboos exist around sex and these taboos often prevent people from finding out really critical
          information about their own sexuality. Also, many people get too much information from consuming pornography,
          but pornography is really far from sexual reality. Too many people think that men must have enormous penises
          to be worthy humans and that women should have a particular size or shape to their vulva to be considered
          <em>normal</em> or <em>attractive</em>. We would like to disprove these impressions by showing what a range
          people really look like.

          <b>Why are two white dudes creating a site like this?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadly, this is a real question we've been asked more than once. Yes, we are two white dudes with plenty of
          privilege. We have been fortunate enough to have had access to a good education. Sure, we may not be the people 
          you would expect to create a site like this. But, we decided that we were perfectly placed to invest vast 
          amounts of time and some money into 3D printers, cameras, computers, plane tickets and a myriad of 
          other expenses. Our goal was to create a free site that we hope will have a postive impact on the people in this 
          world. We will never make money from this site and have no means to recoup a large portion of the money we 
          spent to create this site. This is a labor of love from us to the world.

          <b>Why do you render the models in these weird non-human shades?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We didn't want to make the models in real human skin colors -- computer models tend to look weird with
          human colors. Then there are considerations of skintones in humans and the complex issues that arise
          from them. And finally, we didn't want our models to be gendered in the typical pink and blue shades.
          For these reasons, the colors we allow on our website are clearly not human colors, which avoids all of the
          problems above.

          <b>What is a compound model?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A compound model is when we take two or more normal models, slice them in some way to highlight the difference
          between the models and then join them back together to form a new model. Model <a href="/model/746625-VLNP-2">
          746625-VLNP-2</a> is a great example of a compound model, where the left and the right sides of the model
          were created from two different scans. For the left half of the model, the person was not aroused and for
          the right half of the model the person was aroused. You can clearly see the difference in the skin texture 
          (goose bumps) and that the labia and clitoris has clearly shifted upward.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>How do you create these models?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a model, we take many photographs of the model -- from 30 to as many as 150 photos. While
          the photos are being taken, the model cannot move <b>at all</b>. Even the slightest movement will disrupt
          the process to convert these photos into 3D models, which makes scanning penises (which move while breathing
          and even with the heartbeat!) exceptionally difficult. Scanning vulvas is considerably easier since
          the labia are much closer to the body and therefore move much less. Once we have these pictures we use
          Photogrammetry software to create a 3D model. The process of creating the 3D model and to post-process
          the model to fix flaws and artifacts created by the software is more of an art form than it is a science.
          The process is time-intensive, computing power intensive and requires a fine attention to detail and 
          mountains of patience.

          <b>All of these models are available for download. What am I allowed to do with them?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything you want, really. We placed every aspect of this project into the public domain via
          a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">Creative Commons CC0</a> 
          dedication. This means that you are free to print these models and sell them if you want! You can
          also use these models or surfaces in your own creation -- please do get creative! We do ask that you
          give us credit if possible and ideally retain the model codes that are embedded in the models. This
          allows people to look up the models you used and find out more information about them.
