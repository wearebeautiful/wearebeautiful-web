      <h2>Privacy</h2>

      <p>
        The privacy and security of our volunteer models are our utmost priority.
      </p>

      <h5>A word of caution</h5>

      <p>
         One word of caution to our users who might be inclined to
         try and find out the identity of a model: <b>Don't. Period.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
         The act of asking a person who you know to have participated in this project
         is a violation of their privacy. <b>Do not do this!</b>
         And should you ignore this rule and do so anyway, don't be suprised by
         the answer you get. We're certain you won't like it. Please, be polite!
      </p>

      <h5>All the details</h5>

      <p>
        Each of our models must sign our 
        <a href="{{ static_url('/docs/We_Are_Beautiful_model_agreement.pdf') }}">model release contract</a>, 
        that spells out in plain english what the model's rights and the company's 
        obligations are. If you're curious about the details, click the link
        above and read the contract yourself.
      <p>
      <p>
        The key points in the contract:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>The model has the right to rescind their permission for us to 
             publish their models or to stop participating in the project at 
             any time.</li>
         <li>The company ensures that the privacy of the model is not violated
             and that the model's identity is not revealed by the company.</li>
         <li>The company will not store information that could identify the model
             online. Our servers will not contain this information and the model
             release contracts will never be digitized. Paper only, stored 
             in a secure location in Switzerland.</li>
         <li>The company will provide at least one printed 3D model to each
             of our human models, but we will not otherwise pay our models.
             (The company founders are not getting paid and have covered all
              founding costs out of pocket.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
         The photos that are taken of the model have a limited life span; we are
         obligated to destroy our copies of the photos once this life span has
         expired. We will not keep any of the original photos after this deadline.
      </p>
             
      <p>
         We will keep the raw 3D models that we have generated from the photos 
         offline and will store them as long as we retain permission from the
         model. Having access to the raw 3D models allows us to fix mistakes that
         we may find later and perhaps improve the quality of the models later
         in time.
      </p>

      <p>
         Once we have finished the final models we will release the models online
         under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">Creative 
         Commons CC0</a> dedication, which rescinds all copyright
         over the models and places them into the public domain. Once the model
         files are released and users have downloaded them, it is impossible to
         take the models back from the public. We've made this clear to our
         human models when signing the contract. However, models can rescind
         the permission for us to host the models on our site and for us
         to retain the raw 3D models.
      </p>

      <p>
         Also, we're compliant with the GDPR. The only personally
         identifying data we have for our models is secured offline and will
         never be online. 
         The exact method by which we process the user's data and the process
         for how to rescind permission is laid out in the model release contract.
         Our site does not use cookies, nor do we require logins/registration
         to download the models. We do not want your private information! Our
         servers will log and retain your IP address for up to one week and then
         discard it. We only store IP addresses for a week in order to help
         troubleshoot issues with out traffic and/or our servers. Your IP
         addresses will never be shared or sold with anyone.
