        <h2>Our data explained</h2>

        <p>
           We've taken great care in keeping track of the right data, keeping the needed data private to
           protect the identity of our models and making this data useful.
        </p>

        <h4>Model codes</h4>

        <p>
          All of our models are carefully coded with the URL of this site and a model code:
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 15pt; font-weight: bold">
            453703-VLNN-1
        </p>
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center"><b>453703</b></td>
            <td>
               <p>
                 identifies the human model. You can assume that the models <a href="/model/453703-VLNN">453703-VLNN</a> 
                 and <a href="/model/453703-BSNN">453703-BSNN</a> come from the same human.
               </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center"><b>VLNN</b></td>
            <td>
               <p>
                  identifies the body part, pose, arrangement and excited status of the model. For this example,
                  we have a vulva model, lying down, naturally arranged, not excited. While body part and pose are simple
                  to understand, arrangement and excited need some explanation.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <i>Arrangement</i> concerns if the model has been arranged in any way. Vulva models are a great example; as 
                  some vulvas emerge from  underwear the may be folded or their shape influenced by being constrained 
                  in underwear. Not arranging a vulva in any way, is considered <i>natural</i>. If a vulva is arranged, 
                  perhaps to be symmetrical, it is considered <i>arranged</i>. For some
                  models, like penises, a model may also have the foreskin retracted, in which case the arrangement is 
                  <i>retracted</i>. Compare this <a href="/model/757038-VUNN">naturally arranged vulva</a> with the same 
                  <a href="/model/757038-VLSN">vulva that was arragnged to be spread apart</a>. Or compare this
                  <a href="/model/200102-PLAN">not-retracted penis</a> to this 
                  <a href="/model/554268-PLRN">retracted penis</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <i>Excited</i> takes into account if the model is sexually excited at the time the pictures were taken.
                  This is less important for vulva models, but clearly important for penis models.

              The optional -1 on this model identifies the version of this model. Most of our models will only 
              ever have one version, but this pregnant female already has a few so you can see how her body
              changes during the course of your pregancy: 
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN">week 19</a>,
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN-2">week 27</a>,
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN-4">week 40</a>. We even have compound models were that show
              her during early in the pregnancy vs later in the pregnancy: 
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN-5">week 19 to week 40</a>.
            </td>

        <h4>The three data layers</h4>

        <p>
          We've collected three data layers:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
              This inner layer is the identity, age verification and signature that indicates their consent
              to participate in this project. This data only exists on paper under lock and key and is <b>not
              online, at all</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The middle layer of data contains age, country of origin and self declared ethniticty of each model. 
              This data is only shown to the public in aggregate to show the diversity of our models. This data
              is not public data, but we may consider releasing it to researchers at qualified research institutions.
          </li>
          <li>
              The outer layer of data contains all the public data you find on this site. Hopefully this data is
              not at all useful for identifying the models.
          </li>
        </ol>
