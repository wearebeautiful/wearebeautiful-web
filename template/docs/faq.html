          <b>Why are your models these weird non-human shades?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We didn't want to make the models in real human skin colors -- computer models tend to look weird with
          human colors. Then there are considerations of skintones in humans and the complex issues that arise
          from them. And finally, we didn't want our models to be gendered in the typical pink and blue shades.
          For these reasons, the colors we allow on our website are clearly not human colors, which avoids all of the
          problems above.
