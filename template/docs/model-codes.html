        <h2>Model codes explained</h2>

        <p>
           We've taken great care in keeping track of the right data, keeping the needed data private to
           protect the identity of our models and making this data useful.
        </p>

        <h4>Model codes</h4>

        <p>
          All of our models are carefully coded with the URL of this site and a model code that you can
          decode using the diagram below. The code contains the ID number of the model, the body part shown,
          the pose the person was in at the time of the scan, if they were arranged in some form, if
          they were excited or not and finally the version of this this model:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="{{ static_url_for('static', filename='img/model-decoder.png') }}" style="width: 100%">
        </p>

        <p>
           Let's take one example code and break it into its parts:
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 15pt; font-weight: bold">
            453703-VLNN-1
        </p>
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center"><b>453703</b></td>
            <td>
               <p>
                 identifies the human model. You can assume that the models <a href="/model/453703-VLNN">453703-VLNN</a> 
                 and <a href="/model/453703-BSNN">453703-BSNN</a> come from the same human.
               </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center"><b>VLNN</b></td>
            <td>
               <p>
                  identifies the body part, pose, arrangement and excited status of the model. For this example,
                  we have a vulva model, lying down, naturally arranged, not excited. While body part and pose are simple
                  to understand, arrangement and excited need some explanation.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <i>Arrangement</i> concerns wether the model has been arranged in any way. Vulva models are a great example, as 
                  some vulvas emerge from  underwear they may be folded or their shape influenced by being constrained 
                  in underwear. Not arranging a vulva in any way is considered <i>natural</i>. If a vulva is arranged, 
                  perhaps to be symmetrical, it is considered <i>arranged</i>. Compare this <a href="/model/757038-VUNN">naturally 
                  arranged vulva</a> with the same <a href="/model/757038-VLSN">vulva that was arranged to be spread apart</a>. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  For some models, like penises, a model may also have the foreskin retracted, in which case the arrangement is 
                  <i>retracted</i>. Compare this <a href="/model/200102-PLAN">not-retracted penis</a> to this 
                  <a href="/model/554268-PLRN">retracted penis</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <i>Excited</i> takes into account wether the model is sexually excited at the time the pictures were taken.
                  This data attribute is clearly important for a penis model, but it seems less important for vulva models.
                  However, even vulvas change shape when they are excited, as you can see in this <a href="/model/426060-VLNP">
                  compund vulva model</a>.
               </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center"><b>1</b></td>
            <td>
              The optional -1 on this model identifies the version of this model. Most of our models will only 
              ever have one version, but this pregnant female already has a few so you can see how her body
              changes during the course of her pregancy: 
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN">week 19</a>,
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN-2">week 27</a>,
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN-4">week 40</a>. We even have compound models that show
              her both early in the pregnancy as well as later in the pregnancy: 
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN-5">week 19 to week 40</a>.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
