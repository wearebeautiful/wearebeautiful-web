        <h2>Model codes explained</h2>

        <p>
           We've taken great care to keep track of the right data, keep the necessary data private to
           protect the identity of our models and make the data useful.
        </p>

        <h4>Model codes</h4>

        <p>
          All of our models are carefully coded with the URL of this site and a model code that you can
          decode using the diagram below. The code contains the ID number of the model, the body part shown,
          and the pose the person was in at the time of the scan. It also shows if the model was arranged
          (e.g. arms raised as opposed hanging naturally) and if they were excited (aroused) or not. 
          The final number is the optional version of this model; if it is not shown by default 
          it means the version number is 1. Some models may have repeated scans over time: A pregnant
          woman at week 19 could be version 1 and the same woman at pregnancy week 40 could be version 2.
        </p>

        <p>
           Let's take one example code and break it into its parts:
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 15pt; font-weight: bold">
            453703-VLNN-1
        </p>
        <table class="table">
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center"><b>453703</b></td>
            <td>
               <p>
                 identifies the human model. You can assume that the models <a href="/model/453703-VLNN">453703-VLNN</a> 
                 and <a href="/model/453703-BSNN">453703-BSNN</a> come from the same human.
               </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center"><b>VLNN</b></td>
            <td>
               <p>
                  identifies the body part, pose, arrangement and excited status of the model. For this example,
                  we have a vulva model, lying down, naturally arranged, not excited. While body part and pose are simple
                  to understand, arrangement and excited need some explanation.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <i>Arrangement</i> concerns whether the model has been arranged in any way. Vulva models are a great example, as 
                  some vulvas emerge from  underwear they may be folded or their shape influenced by being constrained 
                  in underwear. Not arranging a vulva in any way is considered <i>natural</i>. If a vulva has been positioned, 
                  perhaps to be symmetrical, it is considered <i>arranged</i>. Compare this <a href="/model/757038-VUNN">naturally 
                  presented vulva</a> with the same <a href="/model/757038-VLSN">vulva that was arranged to be spread apart</a>. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  For models of penises, a model may also have the foreskin retracted, in which case the arrangement is 
                  <i>retracted</i>. Compare this <a href="/model/200102-PLAN">not-retracted penis</a> to this 
                  <a href="/model/554268-PLRN">retracted penis</a>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <i>Excited</i> denotes if the model is sexually excited at the time the pictures were taken.
                  This data attribute is onvious for a penis model, but it seems less obvious for vulva models.
                  However, vulvas also change shape when they are excited, as you can see in this <a href="/model/426060-VLNP">
                  compound vulva model</a>.
               </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center"><b>1</b></td>
            <td>
              The optional -1 on a model identifies the version of this model. Most of our models will only 
              ever have one version, but this pregnant female already has a few so you can see how her body
              changes during the course of her pregancy: 
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN">week 19</a>,
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN-2">week 27</a>,
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN-4">week 40</a>. We even have compound models that show
              her both early in the pregnancy as well as later in the pregnancy: 
              <a href="/model/591522-FSAN-5">week 19 to week 40</a>.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
